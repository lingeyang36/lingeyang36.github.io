# **Exploring the Diverse Paths to Invention of U.S.-trained Doctoral Scientists and Engineers Applied Data Analytics Training**<br/> 
In collaboration with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation and the Coleridge Initiative, participants of this program will work in teams to define and complete a project using the micro-level Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR, provided by NCSES) linked with
United States Patent data (public data provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office). The program aims to provide an up-to-date perspective on using administrative and survey data for policy analysis, along with instruction on data analysis and visualization best practices. The final output would be an interactive dashboard or data visualization that enhances the knowledge of often understudied subpopulations of the U.S. scientific workforce.. <br/>
