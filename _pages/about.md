Hello! Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Agriculture and Resource Economics Department at the University of Connecticut. My research is centered on the intersection of production and environmental economics, focusing on the theoretical foundation, empirical analysis, and policy implications. 

Currently, I am working on projects that aim to promote equity and sustainability in various sectors, including agriculture and manufacturing. 

In addition to my PhD, I am also pursuing my Master of Science in Quantitative Economics.
